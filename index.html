  <p>TO MY WISE QUEER FAMILY THAT I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR:</p>
  <p>I WOULD LIKE TO THROW MY BIRTHDAY PARTY / A CONCEPTUAL DANCE PARTY AT YOUR HOUSE.</p>
  <p>WHAT IS THE CONCEPT: WELL, IT’S PRETTY SIMPLE. AS YOU KNOW, I AM A RAVER. ALSO, IM A DYKE. ESSENTIALLY, I WANT TO THROW A DYKE DANCE PARTY (NOTE: DYKE BEING IMPERFECT SHORTHAND FOR QUEER NOT CIS MEN)</p>
  <p>OVER A LONG WHILE AND MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY PEOPLE, I’VE COME TO THE DESIRE OF STARTING A DYKE DANCE PARTY. I WAS PLANNING ON TRYING TO BOOK AT A VENUE SUCH AS TRANS PECOS WHENEVER THIS IDEA WAS FULLY FLEDGED, BUT SOME FRIENDS CONVINCED ME THAT THROWING IT AT A PRIVATE LOCATION FIRST WOULD BE SMART, SO I COULD COME TO CLUBS WITH PROOF OF ENGAGEMENT FOR THE IDEA.</p>
  <p><span class="requirement">WHAT THIS WOULD REQUIRE OF YOU:</span></p>
  <ol>
    <li>A CONVO WITH ME BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG ASK AND IF YOU STRAIGHT UP DIDN’T WANT THIS HAPPENING I WOULD TOTALLY UNDERSTAND</li>
    <li>FIRST FLOOR BEING USED AS A DANCE FLOOR (THINKING NO 3RD FLOOR ACCESS FOR PARTY-GOERS)</li>
    <li>MAYBE PATIO ACCESS FOR DANCERS TO RELAX AND TAKE A BREAK? (DYKES LOVE TO TAKE A BREAK OUTSIDE THE CLUB)</li>
    <li>A WILLINGNESS TO PARTY UNTIL LATE THAT NIGHT WITH DANCE MUSIC BLARING ON THE FIRST FLOOR - THINKING 10PM TO 4AM VIBES</li>
    <li>A CONVERSATION WITH ME ABOUT A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN YOUR HOME FOR THIS SITUATION. I MADE A LIST OF ALL DYKES (EXPANSIVE) IN MY LIFE THAT I WANT TO INVITE, ITS SURPRISINGLY LONG BUT WE COULD HAVE A STRICT LIMIT IF SO DESIRED</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I LOVE YOUR BIG BEAUTIFUL HOME AND EVERYONE WITHIN IT. IF THIS TASK WERE TOO CUMBERSOME TO HOLD, I WOULD COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND WOULD NOT BE BOTHERED IN THE SLIGHTEST BIT!</p>
  <p>LET ME KNOW WHAT U THINK :)</p>
